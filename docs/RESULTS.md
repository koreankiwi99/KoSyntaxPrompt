## Analysis of Formal Error Types
To effectively analyze the results, it is crucial to determine whether they logically align with the provided sentences and adhere to a commonsense "If-then" relationship. This process requires a complex approach. Therefore, before delving into content analysis, this study first identified the occurrence rate of formal errors by applying specific rules. Formal errors were categorized into three types:

- **No Result Generated**: Instances where the system fails to produce any answer.
- **Non-Korean Response**: Instances where the response is generated in a language other than Korean or Hangul.
- **Refusal to Generate Response**: Instances where the system refuses to generate an answer, often with messages like "I'm sorry, but there is no specific information available."
