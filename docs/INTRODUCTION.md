# Introduction

## Background 
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP). A notable development is the use of prompting, which involves integrating contextual information into input sentences to guide the model’s output. The success of this technique depends on both the format and content of the prompt. While much research has focused on English prompts, there is comparatively less exploration of prompts in Korean.

## Research Motivation
This paper examines the challenges of translating completion-type prompts from English to Korean, highlighting the unique syntactic and structural differences between the two languages:

(A) English Prompt: "PersonX’s face gets red because he feels ___"
(B) Korean (Direct Translation): "그의 얼굴은 빨개졌는데, 왜냐하면 그는 ___ 느꼈기 때문이다."
(C) Korean (Alternative Format): "그의 얼굴은 빨개졌는데, 왜냐하면 그가 느꼈던 것은 ___"
(D) Korean (Relative Clause): "그는 ___ 느꼈기에, 그의 얼굴은 빨개졌다"
