# Exploring Large Language Model Prompts for Korean If-Then Reasoning Task
This repository contains materials related to my undergraduate graduation thesis, titled "Exploring Large Language Model Prompts for Korean If-Then Reasoning Task: Focusing on Performance Variations Based on Syntactic Structure of Prompts".

## Overview
The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate how different syntactic structures of prompts affect the performance of large language models (LLMs) in Korean if-then reasoning tasks. 
The study focuses on understanding performance variations and optimizing prompt structures to improve reasoning accuracy.
